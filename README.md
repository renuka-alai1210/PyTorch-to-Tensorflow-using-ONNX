ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange Format) is a format designed to represent any type of Machine Learning and Deep Learning model.
ONNX is an open format built to represent machine learning models. ONNX defines a common set of operators - the building blocks of machine learning and deep learning models - and a common file format to enable AI developers to use models with a variety of frameworks, tools, runtimes, and compilers.
